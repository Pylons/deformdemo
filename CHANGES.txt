.. _2.0.15:

2.0.15 (unreleased)
-------------------

- Add support of Python 3.9.

- Added a new widget ``SelectizeWidget`` based on the jQuery plugin
  `selectize.js <https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js>`_. [stevepiercy]
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/260

- Improved handling of the ``readonly`` HTML attribute in certain widgets. The
  ``readonly`` HTML form control attribute makes the element not mutable,
  meaning the user cannot edit the control. When ``"readonly": "readonly"`` is
  one of the items in a dict passed into the ``attributes`` option when
  creating a widget, the rendered widget both prevents the user from changing
  the value, and if the form does not pass validation after submitted then the
  field value will be displayed.

  ``readonly`` is supported by most form controls, but not all. Deform adds
  some logic to add read-only support for a few of those form controls, as
  described below.

  ``CheckboxWidget`` and ``CheckboxChoiceWidget``
    Due to the nature of how checkbox values are processed, the ``readonly``
    attribute has no effect.
    To achieve a read-only behavior, pass in ``attributes={"onclick": "return
    false;"}``.
    This will render as an inline JavaScript ``onclick="return false;"`` for
    each checkbox item.

  ``MoneyInputWidget``
    The provided value will be displayed in the input and be not editable.

  ``RadioChoiceWidget``
    For the selected value it will render an attribute in the HTML as
    ``readonly="readonly"``, and for all other values as
    ``disabled="disabled"``.

  ``SelectWidget``
    For selection of single options only, the selected value will render an
    attribute in the HTML as ``readonly="readonly"``, and for all other values
    as ``disabled="disabled"``.
    Multiple selections, set by the ``multiple=True`` option, do not support
    the ``readonly`` attribute on the ``<select>`` element.
    For multiple selections, use the ``SelectizeWidget``.

  ``SelectizeWidget``
    For both single and multiple selections, the selected value or values will
    be rendered as selected, and the others will not be selectable.
    Selectize uses JavaScript to "lock" the form control.

  ``TextAreaWidget``
    The provided value will be displayed in the input and be not editable.

  ``TextInputWidget``
    The provided value will be displayed in the input and be not editable.

- Optionally bypass the resource registry and specify a resource as a dict
  where its keys are the type of asset (``"js"`` or ``"css"``) and its values
  are either a string or a list of strings of paths to assets on disk.

- Conditionally load ``jquery.maskedinput`` if and only if ``mask`` option is
  provided. [tisdall, stevepiercy]
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/487

- Changed dateparts widget to use ``type="number"`` instead of default `text`.
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/442

- Switch from using nosetests to pytest as the test runner, as nosetests is no
  longer maintained. [stevepiercy]
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/497
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/pull/498

- Add demo and tests for arbitrary HTML5 attributes in widgets.
  https://github.com/Pylons/deform/issues/430

- Added unofficial deformdemo. This provides a space for contributors to add
  their widgets without requiring tests, especially when the functional tests
  cannot pass using Selenium. [sydoluciani]
  https://github.com/Pylons/deformdemo/pull/92

- Switch from Travis-CI to GitHub Actions for running tests and builds.

- Add Docker containerization of Deform and deformdemo as an option for running
  tests, and improve related documentation.
